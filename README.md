# Kickstarting with Excel - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

---
## Overview of Project
This is a classwork example in which "my friend" Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who will be starting a Kickstarter fund to help fund her play  entitled *Fever*. This data analysis will help her track trends in similar past Kickstarter campaigns. Louise will create the play in the U.S. and estimates that her play will cost $12,000. 
### Purpose
We will analyze data from past Kickstarter campaigns that were started for theater projects to be able to see comparable campaign outcomes based on the campaign's launching date as well as outcomes based on the campaign fundraising goals.
