# Kickstarting with Excel - An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

---
## Overview of Project
This is a classwork example in which "my friend" Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who will be starting a Kickstarter fund to help fund her play  entitled *Fever*. This data analysis will help her track trends in similar past Kickstarter campaigns. Louise will create the play in the U.S. and estimates that her play will cost $12,000. 
### Purpose
We will analyze data from past Kickstarter campaigns that were started for theater projects to be able to see comparable campaign outcomes based on the campaign's launching date as well as outcomes based on the campaign fundraising goals. 

A campaign's outcome will be labeled as Successful, Failed, or Canceled. Campaigns were labeled as successful if the amount of money raised surpassed the fundraising goal. They were labeled failed if the campaign did not raiseenough funds to surpass the goal. Canceled campaigns were labeled as such if the campaign was shut down before the end date passed.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From all of the Kickstarter data available, results were filtered to view only campaigns that were categorized as "theater" campaigns. 

Of all campaigns in the theater category, there was a 61% chance of success compared to a 39% chance of failure or cancellation. The largest amount of successful campaigns launched in May. The largest amount of failed campaigns launched in May, June, July, and October. In December, theater campaigns were almost just as likely to fail (47%) as they were to succeed (49%).
